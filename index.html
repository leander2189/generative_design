    <h2>Fractals - Mandelbrot</h2>
    <p>The Mandelbrot fractal is a fascinating mathematical set that exhibits
       intricate and infinitely complex patterns. It was discovered and popularized 
       by the mathematician Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in the 1970s</p>

    <p>The Mandelbrot set is defined in the complex plane, which consists of numbers 
    with real and imaginary parts. Each point in the complex plane represents a 
    different complex number. For a given complex number \(c\), the behavior of the sequence
    \(z_{n+1}=z_n^{2}+c\) is studied.</p>

    <p>The interesting and visually stunning aspect of the Mandelbrot set lies in the points 
      that are outside the set. The iterations can lead to chaotic behavior, generating intricate 
      patterns with intricate detail, no matter how closely you zoom in. These patterns exhibit 
      self-similarity, meaning that smaller and smaller portions of the set resemble the overall 
      shape of the set.</p>

    <p>When graphically visualizing the Mandelbrot set, points inside the set are usually colored 
      black, while the colors of the points outside the set are determined based on the number 
      of iterations required to reach an escape condition or the magnitude of divergence.</p>
